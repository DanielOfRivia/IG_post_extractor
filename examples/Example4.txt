**General Shopping Tips**

As of 2025, changes are coming, requiring a tax card, paying upfront, and claiming a rebate later. The 100,000 yen ($635) spending cap for tax-free shopping is being removed in 2025. Keep receipts and documents, use an online portal or refund counter before leaving. A minimum spend (e.g., 5,500 yen for sneakers and J-Beauty) is often required for the 10% refund.
*   **Discounts and Coupons:** You can often stack discounts with the tax refund. Look for tourist discount cards (5-10% off) at shopping mall information counters. Check websites like taxfreeshops.jp for coupons for major stores like JINS, BIC CAMERA, and SUNDRUG. Uniqlo has a "Happy Hour" on Tuesdays & Fridays from 2 pm to 5 pm with extra discounts.
*   **Payment:** Using an IC card like Welcome Suica or Digital Suica for trains and buses is convenient and can be used in convenience stores. 7-11 ATMs are recommended for withdrawing cash with no international ATM fees.
*   **Shipping/Luggage:** Consider using coin lockers at stations or luggage forwarding services (Taki-Bin) to handle purchases. Compression bags or hotel compression services can also help make space.
*   **Avoid Bringing Certain Items:** It's suggested not to bring too many clothes (buy Uniqlo/GU), too many beauty products (buy J-Beauty), or snacks (buy local ones).
