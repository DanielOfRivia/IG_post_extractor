Why you should not stay in Shibuya and Shinjuku and where you should stay instead for your trip to Tokyo!

As convenient as these locations are, they are also known for being the busiest areas in Tokyo. The train stations are like a maze and accomodations are really expensive. As Shibuya and Shinjuku are known for their nightlife, it’s not the safest area to walk around at night if you’re a solo traveller or with family.

These 3 areas are the best locations to stay at if you prefer a less crowded and quieter neighbourhood☺️

1. Asakusa
2. Shimbashi
3. Asakusabashi
