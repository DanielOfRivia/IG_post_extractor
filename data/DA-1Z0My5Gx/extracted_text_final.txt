Why you should not stay in Shibuya and Shinjuku and where you should stay instead for your trip to Tokyo!

As convenient as these locations are, they are also known for being the busiest areas in Tokyo. The train stations are like a maze and accomodations are really expensive. As Shibuya and Shinjuku are known for their nightlife, it’s not the safest area to walk around at night if you’re a solo traveller or with family.

These 3 areas are the best locations to stay at if you prefer a less crowded and quieter neighbourhood☺️

1. Asakusa
2. Shimbashi
3. Asakusabashi

 Why I would avoid staying in Shibuya and Shinjuku as someone who has moved here and where I would stay instead. Convenient? Sure, but Shibuya and Shinjuku stations are extremely congested areas. It's not luggage friendly and accommodation can be super expensive. Not to mention, certain areas can get quite noisy and uncomfortable at night for female travellers and families. There are other areas I would recommend which are located along the Toei line and you can easily arrive at these stations from Narita and Haneda airport. Asakusa is only a short train ride away from Ginza and a walking distance to sightseeing spots like Sensoji temple and Tokyo Sky Tree. Hotels are cheaper and the area is peaceful. Shinbashi station is one of the most convenient stations where 7 different train lines intersect here. Hotels are affordable and it's also a walking distance to Ginza. Asakusa Bashi is a quiet residential area and you can find plenty of budget accommodations here. Plus, it's just a walking distance to Akihabara. Let me know your thoughts, like and follow for more and I also post daily.
