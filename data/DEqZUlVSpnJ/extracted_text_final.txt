This might ruin regular soda for you 👀
Hands down the most flavorful soda I’ve ever had…and it’s only $5! Walking into this craft cola shop felt more like stepping into a spice market. They blend over 10 different spices to make their signature cola fresh on the spot! And the best part? It’s not even that sweet so it’ll definitely give Diet Coke a run for its money. I went in the late afternoon and had the place almost to myself. Oh, and you can even buy their cola syrup to make it at home! Save this for your next trip to Shibuya and send this to someone who NEEDS to try this on a hot day!
📍 Iyoshi Cola
