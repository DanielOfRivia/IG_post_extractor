Where can visitors find authentic local experiences and avoid overcrowded tourist spots?

Based on the sources, here are some locations where visitors can find authentic local experiences and potentially avoid overcrowded tourist spots in Japan:

**In Osaka:**

*   **Kuromon Market** is described as a place where "most people just walk past or walk through without realizing what's around them". It offers fresh Osaka food ready to be grilled or fried in front of you. You can also find locally made and packaged goodies, which are good souvenirs, and there are free tastings available. It's tucked away in a busy part of Osaka, just five minutes from Shinsaibashi and ten minutes away from Dotonbori Bridge, allowing you to "get away from all the craziness and enjoy the taste of local Osaka".
*   **Osaka Kizu Wholesale Market** is presented as an alternative to Kuromon Market, which the source suggests tourists might find overpriced. Kizu is a market that regional people frequent and is closed on weekends. However, it is open to the public during certain hours, with the best time being from 8:30 to 10:30 a.m.. Visiting in the early morning hours allows you to experience the energy and variety of an authentic Japanese market.
*   **Ura Namba** contains hidden gems and backstreets filled with cozy izakayas and trendy bars. You can ask locals for recommendations or try a bar crawl for a full experience. It's a six-minute walk from Namba Station.
*   **Tenma** is mentioned for bar hopping, where you can try kushiyaki (grilled skewers), sashimi, and sake at different spots for variety.
*   **Shinsekai** is described as retro chic & amazing food. You can have dinner there and try Osaka’s famous kushikatsu (deep-fried skewers) for an authentic experience. It's located in the retro Shinsekai district and is presented as an alternative to Dotonbori.
*   The alley behind the **Dotonbori Bridge**, after you see the fist and the Golden Baby, is highlighted as "one of the coolest streets in Osaka that most people just walk past every day". It's also an amazing photo spot. This street is full of small local restaurants and drink spots and "won't be populated by a lot of tourists, so you'll actually be able to sit down and eat". There is also a ton of awesome art back here.
*   **Minoo Waterfall** offers a refreshing escape from the city, reachable via a scenic 45-minute trail from Minoh Station. It provides a peaceful journey through nature.
*   **Katsuo-ji Temple**, known as the "Winning Temple," is a peaceful temple filled with daruma dolls. You can write your wish on a daruma for good luck. It's about a 15-minute taxi ride from Minoh-kayano Station.

**In Tokyo:**

The sources suggest avoiding staying in **Shibuya** and **Shinjuku** due to them being the busiest and most congested areas with expensive accommodation, noisy nightlife, and not being luggage friendly.
Instead, consider staying in less crowded and quieter neighborhoods like:
*   **Asakusa:** A peaceful area. It's a short train ride from Ginza and walking distance to sightseeing spots like Sensoji Temple and Tokyo Sky Tree. Hotels are cheaper here. Asakusa also has Japan’s oldest existing underground shopping center, accessible from Asakusa Station, which houses local businesses and the owner wishes more tourists would visit.
*   **Shimbashi:** One of the most convenient stations with 7 different train lines intersecting, and hotels are affordable. It's also walking distance to Ginza.
*   **Asakusabashi:** A quiet residential area with plenty of budget accommodation and within walking distance to Akihabara.

Alternatives to specific crowded spots in Tokyo include:
*   Avoiding **Shibuya Crossing** and visiting **Daikanyama** instead for cozy cafes & shops without the mess. Daikanyama is described as Tokyo's Brooklyn, blending sophistication and chill with a comfy, welcoming vibe.
*   Avoiding **Takeshita Street** in Harajuku and visiting **Shimokitazawa** for shopping with a soul. Shimokitazawa is where creativity thrives, with retro shops and underground live houses. It's also a go-to spot for vintage and Showa-era fashion finds and a good place for thrifting, offering genuine deals compared to Shibuya or Harajuku.
*   Avoiding **Mount Fuji’s Trail** during peak season and hiking **Mount Takao** instead for stunning routes close to Tokyo. Mount Takao is a popular hiking spot with beautiful views, especially in autumn.
*   Avoiding **Tsukiji Outer Market** and visiting the **New Toyosu Market** for fresh seafood in a fancy Japanese style.
*   Instead of the expensive **Skytree**, you can get the same views, souvenirs, and cafes for free at the **Tokyo Metropolitan Observatory**.
*   For vintage shopping, exploring **Kichijoji, Koenji, and Jiyugaoka** is recommended over Shibuya and Harajuku for genuine deals.
    *   **Kichijoji**, especially the "Harmonica alley," offers narrow streets of very authentic and local izakayas and bars. It's 15 minutes from Shinjuku and less crowded. The source explicitly notes "no tourists !!" here.
    *   **Koenji** is mentioned as a good place for thrifting.
    *   **Jiyugaoka** is called Tokyo's mini-Europe, a fashionable neighborhood with chic patisseries, flower shops, and trendy interiors, good for a day trip.
*   **Nakano Broadway** is described as Tokyo's weirdest underground market with a crazy mix of goods, including vintage collectibles, anime, manga, retro toys, and various shops and services. It's a five-floor maze that is a must-see.
*   **Gakugei Daigaku** is a local neighborhood just one station from Shibuya, offering a cozy atmosphere, local restaurants, and baths, away from the crowded spots.
*   For less crowded shrines with red torii gates, consider **Nogi Shrine** or **Hie Shrine** in Tokyo. Nogi Shrine is small and picturesque with a short tunnel of gates, while Hie Shrine is an important but lesser-known Shinto shrine.
*   Experiencing **Dagashibar** (in Ebisu, Shibuya, or Shinjuku) offers all-you-can-eat traditional Japanese sweets in a nostalgic Showa-era setting.

**In Kyoto:**

*   Instead of the crowded **Arashiyama Bamboo Grove**, consider the **Sagano Bamboo Forest** which is described as calm and slow. Alternatively, nearby temples like **Adashino Nenbutsuji Temple** or **Gioji Temple** have their own bamboo forests with fewer crowds. Adashino Nenbutsuji is a "hidden gem" just 10 minutes from the Arashiyama Bamboo Forest entrance and features over a thousand unique stone statues.
*   Instead of **Kiyomizu-dera**, visit **Daigo-ji Temple** for gorgeous scenery with much less crowding.
*   Instead of the crowded **Gion District**, explore **Pontocho Alley** for authentic dining without the tourist swarm.
*   To experience **Fushimi Inari** with fewer crowds, you can hike up from the main area (25-45 minutes) to reach other beautiful scenic spots that are often empty, even during peak hours. This allows you to see the Torii gates and other parts of the shrine without people around.
*   **Tenjuan Temple**, near Gion, is described as the "quietest spot in Kyoto". It's a serene Buddhist temple with a koi pond and stunning garden, costing only $2 to enter. It offered the most peaceful part of the day for one visitor.
*   Hidden food spots mentioned include **Rokujuan**, a 100-year-old tea house with amazing gardens and a unique dessert, **Gion Tanto** for highly-rated okonomiyaki in a retro setting, and **Gion Unagi Kawato** for authentic unagi prepared by a master chef in a shop with historical elements.

**Other Locations:**

*   **Nara Park:** Instead of the main park, visit **Wakakusa Hill** for amazing views that are less crowded.
*   **Koyasan:** Described as an incredible spot for a day trip from Osaka (about 1.5 hours by train and cable car/bus) that very few tourists visit. You can visit temples like Okunoin Temple with ancient graves and massive cedar trees, sample vegan Buddhist food, and even stay overnight in a Buddhist monastery. The source notes "no tourists?!" here.
*   **Kanazawa:** Suggested as a place to visit if you want to travel beyond Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka and get away from the crowded tourist spots. Only 2.2% of tourists visit. It's considered the "little Kyoto". The **Higashi Chaya District** has rich history, local food, and teahouses over 200 years old. Kanazawa also offers unique experiences like gold leaf crafting. (Note: Kanazawa is a city outside the major metropolitan areas).
